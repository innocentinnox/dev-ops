# DevOps Documentation

Welcome to the DevOps documentation repository! This folder contains a series of guides, workflows, and configurations for managing, automating, and deploying various infrastructure components efficiently. Each sub-folder is dedicated to a specific DevOps area, such as automation, deployment, backup scheduling, and other CloudPanel configurations.

## Folder Structure

Here’s an overview of the main folders and their purposes:

- **`cloud-panel/`**  
  Contains configurations and scripts specifically for CloudPanel, a user-friendly hosting control panel that enables easy management of web servers and applications. This folder provides guidance for configuring backups, bypassing GUI limitations, and more.

- **`automation/`**  
  Houses scripts and tools that automate repetitive tasks, such as backup scheduling, server monitoring, and maintenance. This folder will cover topics such as Cron jobs, scripts for cleanup tasks, and resource monitoring.

- **`deployment/`**  
  Contains workflows and deployment scripts that can be used with CI/CD pipelines. You’ll find resources for automating the deployment of applications, handling version control, and setting up continuous integration and delivery.

- **`workflows/`**  
  Guides and YAML files for common workflows, such as automated testing, continuous deployment, and code quality checks, often used in GitHub Actions or other CI/CD systems.
